title: RAID-cluster for backups

Some of my friends have two big hard drives, in which they store everything they have: one for use and other for backup. They might use RAID to mirror them in real time, and some use only one and they do backups every now and then. I'm the second type.

At some point I was running out of space on my 1TB & 500GB hard drive combo, and

I had some old tiny disks lying around. I don't like to buy new electronics, and I decided to do something with them. I looked into how to make a RAID-cluster of all of my spare disks. I had some USB 2 HDD cases and a USB 2.0 hub lying around. I had to buy some super cheap second hand cases too. I decided that slow speed wasn't so bad, so I went with USB 2.0.

I have 2x 500 GB and 2x 250 GB disks, and looked into making a RAID out of these. Fortunately Windows' Drive Management is very smart and can combine different sized drives simply with a press of a button. And there you are! Just put everything into a shoebox, and you're done!

Even though the system uses relatively big amount of energy, it's used so rarely, that it doesn't matter. You should be putting all of your smallest disks into the backup cluster, and use less and more energy efficient disks in your primary system.
